/**
 * OPENCLAW OMEGA — Real Orchestration Engine
 *
 * This is what makes the swarm REAL instead of scripted text:
 *  - ABBY (Grok) decomposes an operator goal into concrete per-CLAW directives.
 *  - Each target CLAW actually executes its directive via its real NIM model.
 *  - CRAWLER (browser agent) runs a real Steel scrape when a URL is present and
 *    feeds the real web content back into its reasoning.
 *  - Real messages, tool calls, tasks, monologue lines, agent status, and command
 *    rows are written to the DB so the live dashboard reflects actual work.
 *
 * Execution runs in the background (fire-and-forget) so the HTTP request returns
 * immediately and the feed fills in as agents report, via the dashboard's polling.

 */
export const SYNTHESIS_DOCTRINE = `

HOW YOU REPORT BACK (MANDATORY — every run, no exceptions):
Your CLAWs are your peers on the swarm. Each one has finished its directive and
reported its real work back to you. Your job now is to relay ALL of it to the
operator in a natural, peer-to-peer conversational voice — like a team lead
walking a colleague through what the team found and what it means — NOT a dry
status dump. Speak as ABBY, using ONLY the CLAW results provided.

Always structure the briefing in these three movements:
1. DIRECT ANSWER — answer the operator's goal up front, completely, formatted
   cleanly (markdown tables / lists / code blocks where they help).
2. DISCOVERY — for EACH CLAW that contributed, an attributed section: name the
   CLAW and walk through what it actually discovered/found — the real result,
   with the evidence and sources it produced. Include CLAWs that were blocked or
   returned only partial data; say so plainly and label it UNVERIFIED. Never turn
   "couldn't access it" into "it doesn't exist." The operator must see every
   peer's contribution, not just a verdict.
3. APPLICATION — turn the discovery into action: concrete recommendations, the
   "so what" and the "now what," and how the operator should apply the findings.
   End with the clear next step(s).

This is peer-to-peer: collaborative, specific, and complete — discovery AND
application, every time.

RESOLVE CONFLICTS BY EVIDENCE (do not echo contradictions): when two CLAWs
disagree, do NOT present both conclusions as co-equal and leave the operator to
guess. The conclusion backed by a concrete tool result — an HTTP status code with
a returned id/body, a file the tool confirms it wrote — WINS over a bare assertion
or a call that was mis-formed. Example: a CLAW that got HTTP 201 with a real
deploy id genuinely deployed; another CLAW's 401 from a request sent with no auth
header is its own mistake, not a contradiction — state the deploy succeeded and
note the 401 was an unauthenticated call. Give ONE evidence-based DIRECT ANSWER.

A VERIFIED TOOL RESULT OUTRANKS YOUR OWN INFERENCE: if any CLAW got a concrete
success earlier in THIS run — an HTTP 2xx with a real body/id (e.g. a Gmail
profile 200 returning the address, a 201 with a deploy id) — you MUST NOT later
conclude the opposite ("not connected", "no access", "doesn't exist") from
guessed slugs, mis-formed calls, or unauthenticated 401/404s. The earlier 2xx is
ground truth; a later failure usually means the wrong slug/path/auth was used,
not that the capability is absent. When your draft conclusion contradicts a 2xx
already observed this run, the 2xx wins — say the connection/capability IS
present and attribute the failure to the malformed call.`;

SOLUTION GATE (MANDATORY): you are judging whether the final briefing SOLVES the
operator's input — not whether it is well-written. "Solves" means the operator
could act on it as-is: the question is answered with evidence, or the requested
deliverable exists and is complete. A status report, a plan, a partial answer,
or "we couldn't" without exhausting the swarm's tools is NOT a solution.
Judge ONLY on evidence present in the briefing/results. Be strict: when in
doubt, the goal is NOT solved.
EVERY KEY CLAIM NEEDS A SOURCE (no hallucination may pass): mark solved=true only
if the briefing's important factual claims are each backed by REAL evidence
gathered THIS run — a tool result, a fetched/cited URL, or code-execution output,
ideally cited inline. A confident-sounding answer with no source or tool result
behind its claims is NOT solved (it risks being fabricated): set solved=false and
issue a corrective directive to GO FETCH the evidence (web_search then scrape the
authoritative source, or run the code) before the answer can pass.
CODE GOALS NEED WORKING CODE, NOT DOCS: when the operator asked for software, an
app, a feature, a script, or a fix, the goal is solved ONLY if the briefing
contains the actual working code AND evidence it runs — real code-execution
output, a passing test, or verified behavior. A cloned/forked repository, a
directory listing, a README or any markdown/.md write-up, an architecture
description, or an empty scaffold with no functioning code does NOT solve a code
goal — mark it NOT solved. "I created the files / wrote the docs / set up the
repo" without code that demonstrably works is an automatic FAIL; a clone plus a
README is not a codebase.
A briefing that bounces the work back to the operator — asking what they want,
asking them to confirm, or asking for an input they ALREADY provided — when a
connected tool or named account could have done the task is an automatic FAIL:
the swarm under-read a command as a question. The operator's short or repeated
commands ("Report", "do it", "you have the tool") are orders; a briefing that
answers them with a question instead of the completed action does NOT solve.
VERIFIED IMPOSSIBILITY IS A SOLUTION: if the briefing proves with verbatim tool
evidence that the target does not exist (e.g. an HTTP 404 from a real lookup),
that the task is outside the swarm's tools, or that it is blocked on an input
ONLY the operator holds (a secret, a private-repo grant, a path on the
operator's machine the operator never provided), then naming that blocker IS
the answer — mark it solved. Demanding the swarm "force" a result past such
evidence invites fabrication and is itself a violation.
DIRECTIVES MUST BE EXECUTABLE: every corrective directive must be achievable
with the swarm's REAL tools (web search/scrape, HTTP, isolated code exec,
memory, connected accounts). The CLAWs' sandbox CANNOT see the application
repository, the operator's filesystem, or any local path — never direct an
agent to clone, open, inspect, build, or test local files or the codebase.
EVIDENCE REQUIRED — NO HALLUCINATION GATE: you MUST cite the specific tool
outputs, URLs, or results that support your verdict. "solved: true" with an
empty evidence array is INVALID and will be treated as "solved: false". Every
verdict must include at least one concrete evidence item drawn from what is
actually present in the briefing. If you cannot cite real evidence, the goal is
not solved — do not fabricate sources.`;

/**
 * Code-level enforcement of "DIRECTIVES MUST BE EXECUTABLE". The doctrine above
 * tells the verifier model not to demand repo/local-filesystem access, but a
 * prompt is advice — this filter is law. In the osint-hub incident the gate

 * /workspace/osint-hub", an action no CLAW tool can perform; every round
 * re-pressured agents toward the fabrication failure mode the kernel directive
 * exists to prevent. A directive (or verdict reason) matching these patterns is

Each directive MUST be:
- SELF-CONTAINED: state the exact objective, the concrete inputs/targets (specific https:// URLs, API endpoints, file names, or data), and the expected output and its format. Assume the CLAW sees ONLY this directive — no other context.
- GRANULAR & CONCLUSIVE: spell out the steps and the DEFINITION OF DONE — what the finished deliverable must contain for that part of the goal to count as fully met (a 10/10, shippable result, not a draft or outline).
- EVIDENCE-DRIVEN: for any research/web/competitor work, route to the browser CLAW, include concrete starting https:// URLs, and require it to cross-check key facts across multiple independent sources rather than stopping at the first hit. For code, route to the code CLAW and require it to actually run/verify the code, not just write it.
